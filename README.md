## General info
This project consisted of creating multi-step form.

Users should be able to:
* Complete each step of the sequence
* Go back to a previous step to update their selections
* See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
* View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
* See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
* Receive form validation messages if:
  ** A field has been missed
  ** The email address is not formatted correctly
  ** A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

The project was written in NEXT.JS, as part of a consolidation of the acquired knowledge.
